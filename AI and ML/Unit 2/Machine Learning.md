# Machine Learning

Machine Learning is a branch of Artificial Intelligence that teaches machines to learn and improve their performance on specific tasks by recognizing patterns in data. Compared to traditional algorithmic approaches, ML can analyse complex situations, adapt to new data and provide greater accuracy and efficiency.

The whole Machine Learning system is based on finding common patterns in the data, called **training set**, which then will be used to make a prediction on new input data.

> The output prediction on the input data can take values of various types, based on the application of the ML algorithms; for example:
> 
> - Discrete labels $\rightarrow Y \subset \mathbb N$
> 
> - Continuous labels $\rightarrow Y \subseteq \mathbb R$
> 
> - Hyper-dimensional vectors, e.g. from the same space of the input data $\rightarrow Y \subset \mathbb R^d$

- [Supervised Learning](/AI%20and%20ML/Unit%202/Supervised%20Learning/Supervised%20Learning.md)

- Deep Learning

- Reinforced Learning

## Limits of Machine Learning

TK labels

-   Noise in the data or in the labels
-   Datasets could have historical bias
-   In some cases, ML = blackbox that cannot explain why a prediction was made
