# Machine Learning

Machine Learning is a branch of Artificial Intelligence that teaches machines to learn and improve their performance on specific tasks by recognizing patterns in data. Compared to traditional algorithmic approaches, ML can analyse complex situations, adapt to new data and provide greater accuracy and efficiency.

The whole Machine Learning system is based on finding common patterns in the data, called **training set**, which then will be used to make a prediction on new input data.

## Types of Machine Learning

- [Supervised Learning](/AI%20and%20ML/Unit%202/Supervised%20Learning.md)
- [Unsupervised Learning](AI%20and%20ML/Unit%202/Unsupervised%20Learning.md)
- Reinforced Learning

## Limits of Machine Learning

TK labels

-   Noise in the data or in the labels
-   Datasets could have historical bias
-   In some cases, ML = blackbox that cannot explain why a prediction was made
