# Supervised Learning

Supervised learning is a type of [machine learning](AI%20and%20ML/Unit%202/Machine%20Learning.md) in which an algorithm learns to make predictions or decisions by training on a labelled dataset, which consists of input data and the corresponding output label.

The goal of supervised learning is to learn a mapping function from the input variables to the output variables. Once the mapping function is learned, it can be used to make predictions on new, unseen data.

> Based on the label, there exist two types of supervised learning prediction:
> - **Classification,** when the label is a discrete value. Could be *binary* (0/1) or *multi-class* (1 to $N$);
> - **Regression,** when the output is a continuous value.
