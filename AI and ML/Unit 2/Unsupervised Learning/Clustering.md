# Clustering

Clustering is a machine learning technique that involves grouping similar data points together into clusters. It is unsupervised, meaning that it doesn't require any labelled data to be trained on.

Clustering algorithms attempt to find patterns and similarities in the data based on the features of each data point. The resulting clusters can be used for a variety of purposes, such as identifying subgroups within a larger population, detecting anomalies or outliers in the data, or even as a pre-processing step for other machine learning tasks.
