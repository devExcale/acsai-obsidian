# Dijkstra's Algorithm

Dijkstra's algorithm is a widely used algorithm for finding the shortest path in a graph from a given source node to all other nodes. It works for both weighted and unweighted graphs, but it is commonly used with non-negative edge weights. The algorithm uses a greedy approach to iteratively expand the frontier and update the shortest path distances to the nodes.
