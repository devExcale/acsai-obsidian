# Binary Representation
---

Using the system explained in [Representing Numbers](/Representing Numbers.md#Numbers Encoding), we can define the **binary code**:

$$ \large b=2 \quad \Sigma = \{0,1\} $$

The single digits 0 and 1 are called *bit*, contraction for *binary digit*.

The pioneer of this "language" is *George Boole*, which realised an entire algebraic system on top of binary code. Moreover, there's a real correspondence between binary algebra and the behaviour of digital circuits, core logic of today's machines.

Almost every piece of information can be represented (or approximated) in a way or another with binary code:
- [Integer numbers](/Integers Encoding.md)
- [Rational numbers](/Rationals Encoding.md)
- [Alphabet characters](#)
- Images
- Sounds
