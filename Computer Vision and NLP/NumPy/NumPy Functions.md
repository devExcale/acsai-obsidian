# NumPy Functions

#### Zeroes

The function `np.zeros` creates a matrix initialized with zeroes.

The prototype of the function is `np.zeros(sizes)`, where:

- `sizes` is an array containing the sizes of the matrix. The first two elements represent the number of rows and columns respectively, the third element represents the number of channels, which if not provided defaults to 1 (grayscale).
