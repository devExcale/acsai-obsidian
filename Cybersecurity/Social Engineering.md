# Social Engineering

Social engineering is a tactic often employed by attackers to manipulate individuals into divulging confidential information or performing actions that compromise security. This form of attack relies on psychological manipulation rather than technical exploits.

## List of Social Engineering Techniques

- **Phishing:** attackers send deceptive emails or messages, often posing as legitimate entities, to trick recipients into revealing sensitive information like passwords or financial details.

- **Pretexting:** attackers create a fabricated scenario to gain the victim's trust. This can involve impersonating someone in authority or creating a false emergency to solicit information.

- **Baiting:** malicious software or files are disguised as appealing downloads, such as free software or media, to lure victims into installing malware on their systems.

- **Tailgating:** attackers physically follow an authorized person into a restricted area, taking advantage of their access privileges.

- **Quid pro quo:** attackers offer a service, such as technical support, in exchange for sensitive information. Once they have the information, they exploit it for malicious purposes.
