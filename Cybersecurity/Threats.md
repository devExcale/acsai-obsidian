# Threats

A **threat** refers to any potential danger or risk that can exploit vulnerabilities in computer systems, networks, or data. Threats can include malicious actors, malware, viruses, hackers, and any circumstances or events that may compromise the security and integrity of digital assets.

A **threat agent**, often referred to as an **adversary**, is an entity or actor that poses a threat to a computer system, network, or organization's security. This adversary can be an individual, group, or automated program with malicious intent.

> 
> A **vulnerability** is a weakness or flaw in a computer system, network, or software application that could be exploited by malicious actors or threats. These vulnerabilities can create security risks, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data breaches, or system disruptions.
> 
> A **risk** refers to potential harm from digital threats like data breaches and operational disruptions. Managing it involves identifying vulnerabilities and implementing security measures.

A **countermeasure** refers to a proactive or defensive action taken to mitigate or prevent security threats and vulnerabilities.Â Countermeasures can include implementing security protocols, using encryption, regularly updating software, conducting security audits, and educating users about safe computing practices.

## Attacks

Cyberattacks encompass a wide range of malicious activities targeting computer systems and networks. They can be categorized into two main types: passive and active attacks.

- **Active attack:** a deliberate and malicious action where an attacker attempts to compromise, alter, or damage a computer system, network, or data.
- **Passive attack:** a type of threat where an attacker intercepts and observes data transmissions or communications without altering or disrupting them, for a certain goal.

Moreover, two additional categories of attacks can be defined: inside and outside attacks.

- **Inside attack:** the threat or breach originates from within an organization's own network or system. This can involve authorized users, employees, or individuals with privileged access who misuse their credentials or access rights for malicious purposes.
- **Outside attack:** the intrusion or threat originates from external sources, such as malicious hackers or entities not affiliated with the targeted organization. These attackers attempt to gain unauthorized access to computer systems, networks, or data from outside the protected perimeter.

### List of Active Attacks

#### Replay Attack

In a replay attack, an attacker intercepts data transmissions and then retransmits the same data at a later time to impersonate the legitimate user or gain unauthorized access. This can result in the re-execution of commands or transactions, potentially causing security breaches or fraudulent activities.

#### Masquerade Attack

In a masquerade attack, an attacker impersonates a legitimate user by using stolen or forged credentials. This type of attack aims to gain unauthorized access to a system or network under a false identity, often with malicious intent.

#### Modification of Messages

In a message modification attack, an attacker intercepts data packets or messages in transit and alters their content before forwarding them to the intended recipient. This can lead to unauthorized changes in data, compromising data integrity and confidentiality.

#### Denial of Service

A denial of service attack aims to disrupt or disable the availability of a computer system, network, or service by overwhelming it with a flood of requests or malicious traffic. This results in the target becoming inaccessible to legitimate users, causing service disruptions.

### List of Passive Attacks

#### Release of Message Contents

In a passive attack involving the release of message contents, an attacker intercepts data transmissions without altering them but gains unauthorized access to the actual message content. The attacker can eavesdrop on sensitive information, such as private conversations, confidential documents, or login credentials, potentially compromising data confidentiality.

#### Traffic Analysis

Traffic analysis is a passive attack where an attacker monitors and analyzes patterns of data traffic flowing between network nodes or communication endpoints. While not directly accessing message content, the attacker can infer valuable information by examining factors like packet timing, size, and frequency. Through traffic analysis, attackers may deduce network topology, user behaviors, or even the nature of the communication itself, posing a threat to data privacy and security.
