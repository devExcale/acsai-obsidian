# Encryption

Encryption regards the transformation of information using a secret, called an *encryption key*, so that the transformed information can only be read using another secret, called the *decryption key*.

There are two types of encryption:

- **symmetric encryption,** when the decryption key is the encryption key;
- **asymmetric encryption,** when the decryption key differs from the encryption key.
