# Hash Functions

A hash function is a mathematical function that takes an input, called *message*, and returns a fixed-length string of characters. The output, known as the **hash value** or **hash code**, is *supposedly* unique to the input data (though there could be collisions).

Hash functions are widely used in data integrity verification, password storage, digital signatures, and cryptographic applications to ensure data security and consistency.
