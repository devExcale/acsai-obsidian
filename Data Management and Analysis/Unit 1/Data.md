# Data

**Data** is a collection of discrete values that convey information, describing quantity, quality, fact, statistics, other basic units of meaning, or simply sequences of symbols that may be further interpreted.

Data can be stored in two ways:
- **Structured**, data is represented with a fixed format (strings of symbols or numbers, like the table above);
- **Unstructured**, data is written an natural text.

> [!tip] Data vs Information
> **Data** is different from **information** because data lacks **context**, whereas information can be seen as contextualized data.

> [!example] Information Example
> 
> We can say that the following table contains *information*, because with the rows is provided an heading, which contextualizes the various attributes.
