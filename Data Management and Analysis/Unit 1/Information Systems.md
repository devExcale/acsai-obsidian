# Information Systems

An **information system** is an integrated set of components for collecting, storing, and processing data and for providing information and knowledge. An information system must allow its users actions such creation, updating and interrogation of such information.

The notion of information system is independent of the actual implementation, and have been since long used (e.g. medical records, phone records). Nowadays, information systems are implemented through **[Databases](/Data%20Management%20and%20Analysis/Unit%201/Databases.md)**.

- Database Management System
- Application Software (to access the DB)
- Computer Hardware (storage devices)
- Personnel developing, managing or using the system
