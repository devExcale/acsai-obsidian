# Hyperplanes

A hyperplane is a subspace of a higher-dimensional space that has a dimension one less than the ambient space. For example, in a two-dimensional space, a hyperplane is a one-dimensional line, while in a three-dimensional space, it is a two-dimensional plane.

Hyperplanes can be represented by equations of the form

$$\large
	a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2 + \dots + a_n x_n = b,
$$

where $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ are constants and $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$ are the variables, $n$ is the dimension of the space.

The equation of a hyperplane can also be represented in vector form as

$$\large
	\vec a \cdot \vec x = b,
$$

where $\vec a$ is a vector normal to the hyperplane and $\vec x$ is a vector representing a point in the hyperplane.

A hyperplane divides the space into two half-spaces, one on each side of the hyperplane. A point is said to be on one side of the hyperplane depending on which half-space it lies in, the dot product with the normal vector can be used to find it out.
