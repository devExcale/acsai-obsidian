# Linear Equations


A linear equations is a basic type of equation where all the unknowns have exponent equal 1. All unknowns are grouped on the left, while the known values are on the right.

Usually, all the values belong to the Real set, so the equation takes the following form:

$$ \large a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2 + \dots + a_n x_n = b
\quad a_i, b \in \mathbb{R} $$
