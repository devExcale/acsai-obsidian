# Linear Equations
A linear equations is a simple equation where all the unknowns and their coefficients are grouped on the left, while the known values are on the right.

Usually, all the values belong to the Real set, so the equation takes the form

$$ a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2 + \dots + a_n x_n = b
\; \; s.t.\; a_i, b \in \mathbb{R} $$
