# Linear Algebra

Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals with linear equations and their representations in terms of vectors and matrices.

It is used to solve systems of linear equations, to analyse and model data, and to study the geometry of objects in space. Linear algebra plays a crucial role in many areas of modern mathematics and has important applications in fields such as computer graphics, cryptography, and signal processing.
