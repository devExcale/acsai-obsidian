# Measurements
---

To start working with physics, we first need some values to work with. Using the real world, we can *take measurements* which they give us the values we need.

It'd be bad if everybody reads measurements in their own different way, so the **International System of Units (SI)** defines a systematic way to take measurements, so that everybody can read values the same.

The **SI** defines three things to take measurements:
- Base quantities
- Unit of Measure
- Standards


#### Base Quantities

Base quantities are certaint types of measurement which are independent from other quantities. Base quantities, and the other quantities, must be invariable.

For example, length and time are base quantities, because they are taken independently. Speed, on the other hand, is NOT a base quantity, because it's a ratio of length and time.


#### Unit of Measure

The unit is a fixed quantity we assing to a measurement, every measurement will be written as a multiple of said unit.

#### Standards

Standards are a way to take precise and uniform measurements of quantities around the world.

Examples of accesible standards are rulers for length and cronometers for time, but there are more precise standards which define units.

- **\[Length / Meter]** Length path travelled by light in a vacuum during a time interval of 1/299'792'458 of a second;
- **\[Time / Second]** Time taken by $9.192\dots \times 10^9$ oscillations of light of a specific wavelength emitted by Casium-133 atom;
- **\[Mass / Kilogram]** Cylinder of Platinum/Iridium kept at the International Bureou of Weight and Measurement in Paris.
