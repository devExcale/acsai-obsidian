# Graphs

Graphs are useful tools that represent data. They give a shape to the data, which makes finding out further information possible, such as the distribution of the data.

## Pie Chart

The pie chart is a graph for qualitative data. It is a circle where each category is represented as a *weighted slice of pie*, where the weight is the proportion of the category.

> The pie chart makes it easy to compare one category with the others, but it may be unsuitable for too many categories.

## Bar Chart

The bar chart is a graph for qualitative data. It is a canvas with multiple vertical detached bars, each bar represents a category and the bar's height can either be the value or the relative frequency of the category.

## Dot Plot

The dot plot is a graph for quantitative discrete data. It is composed of a horizontal ordered axis which represents the possible modalities of an observation, for each observation a dot is placed above the axis on the respective value.

## Histogram

The histogram is a graph for quantitative continuous data. It is similar to a mix of a bar chart and a dot plot, it is composed of bars of equal width with no gap between them, over an horizontal ordered axis representing the modalities of the variable.

Each bar represents an interval of values, called *class*, its height can either be the frequency of the values in the class or the relative frequency of the class.

## Single Time Series

The single time series is a graph used to display quantitative data over a span of time. It's a plane where the horizontal axis represents a point in time, the vertical axis represents the quantitative values of a variable.

Over time, data is collected in intervals of time, then the observations
$\text{(x=time, y=variable)}$
are mapped on the plane and joined by a segment in order of time. Common patterns over times can be noted, and they're called *trends*.
