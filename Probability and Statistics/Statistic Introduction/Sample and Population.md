# Sample and Population

When studying a certain characteristic of an entire set, the whole set should be studied, but when the cardinality of the set is huge this is clearly impossible. So, a smaller number of elements in the set are studied, hoping that the results won't vary much from the whole reality.

> [!note] Population
> 
> The population is the entire set of possible elements in which a study is interested, e.g. individuals, schools, rats, countries, days, widgets.

> [!note] Sample
> 
> A sample is a subset of the population from which information is actually collected.

To conduct a study, samples are observed and the result is *inferred* to the whole population, with a certain margin of error. The margin of error is proportional to the difference of cardinalities between the population and the sample: the smaller the difference, the smaller the margin of error.

> [!example] Predicting an Election
> 
> 9.5 million people voted an election, of which 3889 have been interviewed. The goal of the study is to predict the results of the election.
> 
> The population is the 9.5 million people that voted, the sample is the 3889 people that have been interviewed.

## Parameters and Statistics

The concept of parameters and statistics is derived from the [sample and population](/Statistics/Sample and Population.md).

> [!note] Parameter
> 
> A **parameter** is a numerical summery of the **population**, e.g. people that voted a certain person in an election.

> [!note] Statistic
> 
> A **statistic** is a numerical summary of a **sample**, e.g. randomly selected people that voted a certain person in an election out of all the people that voted.

## Descriptive and Inferential Statistics

A statistic either defines the characteristics a sample or infers the characteristics of a population.

> [!note] Descriptive Statistics
> 
> Techniques of describing data in ways to capture the essence of the information. Summaries consist, for example, of [graphs](?TK) and numbers such as averages and percentages.

> [!note] Inferential Statistics
> 
> Conclusions drawn from data taken from a sample about the population.

> [!example] Descriptive Statistics
> In the previous study, $24\%$ of the people voted candidate A.

> [!example] Inferential Statistics
> From the previous study, we are $95\%$ confident that the percentage of the people who voted for candidate A falls between $22.7\%$ and $25.3\%$.
