# Variables

Variables are characteristics that are observed on the subjects of a study.

> [!example] Variables
> 
> Examples of variables are *height* and *names* in people, *mileage* in cars.

> [!tip] Modalities
> 
> The set of all possible values a variable could take is called **modalities** (*modalities of a variables*).


Variables are divided in two types: *qualitative* and *quantitative*.

## Qualitative Variables

Qualitative (*or categorical*) variables take all non-(pure)-numerical values, e.g. names, yes and no, school year grade.

Qualitative variables are sub-categorised in:

- **Binary,** when there are only two values;
- **Ordinal,** when there's a natural order (hierarchy) between the values;
- **Nominal,** for all other cases.

> [!example] Qualitative Variables
> 
> - **Binary:** gender (*male or female*)
> - **Ordinal:** language certification type (*Cambridge levels*)
> - **Nominal:** religion

## Quantitative Variables

Quantitative variables take numerical values, that represent the different magnitudes the variable can take.

Quantitative variables are sub-categorised in:

- **Discrete,** when the set of values isn't *dense*;
- **Continuous,** when the set of values is *dense*.

> [!example] Quantitative Variables
> 
> **Discrete:** number of family members
> **Continuous:** height

## Relative Frequencies

The **proportion** and **percentage** are two measures useful to compare categories of observations.

> [!note] Proportion
> 
> The proportion of a category is the *frequency* (or *count*) of the observations of the category over the whole number of observations.
> 
> $$\large
> 	\text{proportion} =
> 	\frac{\text{frequency of category}}{\text{number of observations}}
> $$

> [!note] Percentage
> 
> The percentage is the proportion multiplied by 100. Symbolically it's the same thing, but the percentage offers a more concrete feeling: how many units of observation out of 100 fall under the specified category.
