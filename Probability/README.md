# Probability

The study of probability concerns the study of experiments with **random outcomes** (the outcome of an action isn't predetermined), such as the result of tossing a coin.

The study of probability has two main branches:

- **Discrete Probability,** which goal is to study probability on countable sets of outcomes;
- **Continuous Probability,** which goal is to study probability on uncountable sets of outcomes.
