# ACSAI-obsidian

This is a collection of notes I work on after classes by myself,
to set the concepts in my mind and to have a repository full of inter-linked information.

[//]: # (TODO: course introduction)

Every class has a README file, to make the navigation easier.
These files should link every note in the respective class in the order they were written,
feel free to browse for yourself:
- [Computer Architecture](/Computer%20Architecture/index.md)
- [Linear Algebra](/Linear%20Algebra/index.md)
- [Systems and Networking](/Systems%20and%20Networking/README.md)

:warning: **The whole repository is edited through [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), a powerful note-taking software. Notes are written in [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) and  [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/).
To fully visualize the notes, it'd be best to clone the repository and open it with Obsidian.**

My end-goal is to have a net of information where I can link an argument from one class to another, hopefully something that will look like this.
