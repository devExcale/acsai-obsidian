# ACSAI-obsidian

This is a collection of notes I work on after classes by myself,
to set the concepts in my mind and to have a repository full of inter-linked information.

[//]: # (TODO: course introduction)

:warning: **Every note is realized with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/),
a powerful note-taking software.
Notes are written in markdown,
but Obsidian adds custom syntax and [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) support,
which I make use of.
To fully visualize the notes, it'd be best to clone the repository
and open it with Obsidian.**

My end-goal is to have a net of information where I can link
an argument from one class to another,
hopefully something that will look like this.
