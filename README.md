# Applied Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence

This is a collection of notes I work on after classes by myself,
to set the concepts in my mind and to have a repository full of inter-linked information.

[//]: # (TK: course introduction)

Every class has a README file, to make the navigation easier.
These files should link every note in the respective class in the order they were written, feel free to browse for yourself.

:warning: **The whole repository is edited through [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), a powerful note-taking software. Notes are written in [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) and  [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/); the best way to ensure full compatibility of the notes is cloning the repository and opening them through Obsidian.**

My end-goal is to have a net of information where I can link an argument from one class to another, hopefully something that will look like this.

## Used Plugins

A part of the `.obisidian` folder is uploaded in the repository, so plugins should be downloaded automatically. Regardless, here is a list of plugins I'm using to edit the notes.
