# Shapes of Distributions

Given a statistical study's [graph](/Statistics/Data%20Graphs.md), graphical properties can be noted.

## Modality of a Distribution

The modality of a distribution of data is the general shape that the [graph](Statistics/Data%20Graphs.md) assumes when using graphs such as [dot plots](/Statistics/Data%20Graphs.md#Dot%20Plot) and [histograms](/Statistics/Data%20Graphs.md#Histogram).

A graph can

- Be **unimodal**: the data is distributed such that there's a single *mound*. The highest point is at the *mode*;
- Be **bimodal**: the data is distributed such that there are two *mounds*;
- Have no **modality**:  there are no distinct *mounds*.

> [!note] Mound
> 
> A mound, or *peak* (TK confirm), is a collection of classes where the frequencies collectively increase and then decrease.

## Symmetry and Skewness

The shape of a distribution can either be symmetric or skewed to one side.

> [!note] Symmetric Distribution
> 
> A distribution is said to be symmetric if the distribution under the central value (that is, the distribution on the left side of the middle value) is a mirrored image of the distribution above the central value.

> [!note] Skewed Distribution
> 
> A distribution is said to be skewed if the distribution isn't symmetric. It is said to be skewed on one side if the frequencies on that side decrease faster w.r.t. the other side.
