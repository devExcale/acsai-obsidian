# System Buses

A **system bus** is a connection that transfers bit from a component to another.

The primary system buses are:
- **Data bus,** carries actual data
- **Address bus,** carries the addresses to access [memory](/Systems and Networking/Unit 1/Architecture/Memory.md#Representation) (where to read/write)
-  **Control bus,** carries operations and control data

Today, more dedicated buses have been introduces, each with specific functions (e.g. PCI, SATA, USB).
