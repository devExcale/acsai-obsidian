# High-Level Computer Architecture

## Architecture

Today's computers are based on *Von Neumann*'s Architecture.

### I/O Device

Devices that enable the user to interact with the machine

### Memory Unit

It's the workbench of the CPU.

### Central Processing Unit
#### Control Unit


## Hardware

### CPU

It's the processor that executes actual instructions and computations. In modern architectures, there are multiple cores.

It is based on an **Instruction Set (Architecture)**, which is a collection of all the instructions the processor can execute. An instruction is composed of two parts:

- An operator (**opcode**)

- Zero or more operands (representing either registers, memory addresses or literals)

The CPU's architecture can be abstracted 

### Main Memory

Usually RAM, it stores data and instructions used by the CPU.

### I/O Devices

Devices that add functionalities, also called **peripherals**:

- Terminals

- Keyboards

- Disks

- Mice

### System Bus

A communication medium between CPU, memory and peripherals.
