## Application

The application layer is the layer where application logic and [protocols](/Systems and Networking/Unit 2/Protocols.md) reside. The application layer contains the final **message** that [devices](/Systems and Networking/Unit 2/Devices.md) want to exchange.

The packet generated by the Application Layers is called **message**.

The application defines message syntax and semantics on when to exchange messages. An application must also implement an [application architecture](/Systems and Networking/Unit 2/Application Architecture.md).

The application layer makes use of the [transport layer](?TK), so it must decide which protocol to use (either [TCP](?TK) or [UDP](?TK)) based on needed characteristics, as:
- Reliability/Loss
- Connection
- More throughput

Examples of application layer protocols are:
- Web: [HTTP](/Systems and Networking/Unit 2/Protocols/HTTP.md)
- [E-Mail](?TK): SMTP, IMAP, POP3
