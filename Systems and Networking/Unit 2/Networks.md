# Networks

A network is an interconnection of machines so that these machines are able to communicate.
There are various types of networks, some of the most used are:

- Home networks
- Enterprise networks
- Mobile networks
- Internet

A network is composed of many things which permit connection and communication: devices, transport means, middle hardware, protocols.

## Transport means

If two machines need to communicate, there has to be a mean of transport for the data to travel. Based on the network type, there are different options to consider.

**Wired** (A cable which connects two ends, guided)
- Coaxial Cable
- Twisted Pair
- Optic Fibre

**Wireless**: (Radio waves, unguided)
- 

### Coaxial Cable

It's one of the oldest options, it consists of two insulated concentric copper conductors.

This cable can reach high speeds (based on the transmission protocol used), and it finds various usages, e.g.: telephonic transmissions, digital transmissions, television transmissions.
