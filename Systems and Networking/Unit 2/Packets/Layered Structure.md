# Layered Structure

To better organize the [packet](/Systems%20and%20Networking/Unit%202/Packets/Packet.md) structure and services, packets follow a **layered structure**. Each layer follows a [Protocol](/Systems%20and%20Networking/Unit%202/Protocols.md), offers some functionalities, and uses the functionalities of the underlying layer.

The protocol layers could be implemented by both hardware and software, depending on the functionalities needed. When the [Internet](/Systems%20and%20Networking/Unit%202/Networks.md#Internet) was still in development, a theoretical model was developed: the **internet protocol stack**, which is similar to and was later deprecated in favor of the [ISO/OSI Model](/Systems%20and%20Networking/Unit%202/Packets/ISO-OSI%20Model.md).

The internet protocol stack is formed by 5 layers, each layer encapsulates the packet that the upper-layer has passed and adds a functionality to it (in the form of **header**).

| **Layer**                                                                                | **Packet Name** | **Description**                         |

| Link                                                                                     | *Frame*         | Forwarding the packet to the next node. |
| Physical                                                                                 | N/A             | Physically transmitting signals.        |

![Example of packet traveling through layers](?TK)

## Transport

The transport layer is the layer that wraps the application layer and initializes the transport inside the application. A [transport protocol](?TK) is chosen (i.e. TCP or UDP), which also decides how the packet will be handled (e.g. [reliability in TCP](?TK)).

The packet generated by the Transport Layer is called **segment**.

## Network

The network layer provides the service of delivering the segment to the transport layer of the destination host. It works on the **Internet Protocol**, which all network devices must understand. It is also called **IP Layer**, in refer to the fact that the internet protocol is the main protocol keeping the internet connected.

The packet generated by the Network Layer is called **datagram**.

## Link

The link layer is in charge of moving the datagram from one node (host or router) to the next. The characteristics of the link layer change over the protocol of the link (e.g. WiFi, ethernet).

The packet generated by the Link Layer is called **frame**.

## Physical

The physical layer is the final layer that is in charge of physically moving the packet from one device to the other. The means of doing so change depending on the actual [transport means](/Systems%20and%20Networking/Unit%202/Transport%20Means.md).
