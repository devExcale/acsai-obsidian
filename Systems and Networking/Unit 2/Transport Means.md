# Transport means

If two machines need to communicate, there has to be a mean of transport for the data to travel. Based on the network type, there are different options to consider.

**Wired** (A cable which connects two ends, guided)
- Coaxial Cable
- Twisted Pair
- Optic Fibre

**Wireless**: (Radio waves, unguided)
- TK

## Coaxial Cable

It's one of the oldest options, it consists of two insulated concentric copper conductors.
