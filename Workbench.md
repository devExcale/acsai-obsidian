## Agents

Goal based agent

Consequentialism

Instead of storing all possible percepts, the best solution is to start from a subset of it and then include others while learning.

## Automata

- [ ] Finite-State LTS means that it has finite states and actions, Finite-State Automata means that it has to end at some point.

- [ ] Every non-deterministic automata can be represented as a deterministic automata, even though the states and actions may increase.

- [ ]  An FSA is deterministic if the outcome of an action is determined, non-deterministic if the outcome isn't determined (i.e. deterministic if for each state every action leads to one state only, non-deterministic otherwise).

## Searching

- [ ] Graph search vs tree-like search

- [ ] Breadth-first search is complete (if there's a solution it will return it, otherwise it won't)

## Training

A model can't be verified on the same dataset it has been trained on, because the model is kind of guaranteed to reach the expected output. To verify the correctness of a model, a dataset with different data is required, so that the model will try to guess the output on data it has never seen.

## Pearson Correlation Coefficient

The formula calculates the arithmetic means of both x and y, then calculates how much the set of the points change wrt to the mean point. Then, it sums all contributions to calculate the correlation between x and y. 

## Inductive Bias

Different people (and different AI's) have different experiences, which influences the resulting reasoning.

## Eigendecompositions

- [ ] PCA: point cloud should be centred by subtracting mu

- [ ] PCA: point cloud should be divided by sigma to round the cloud

- [ ] Another PCA interpretation: find an orthogonal projection that minimises the reconstruction error

- [ ] What if the sample cardinality is smaller than the data dimensionality

- [ ] There is a way to retrieve the Principal Components from SVD

Forchetta: the range of values a variable could assume.

Data are a random sample of characteristics 

Unit profile: connection between an individual and a unit group

Profile of a specific unit: combination of all values for a ?
