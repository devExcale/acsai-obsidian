Goal based agent

Consequentialism

Instead of storing all possible percepts, the best solution is to start from a subset of it and then include others while learning.

## Training

A model can't be verified on the same dataset it has been trained on, because the model is kind of guaranteed to reach the expected output. To verify the correctness of a model, a dataset with different data is required, so that the model will try to guess the output on data it has never seen.

## Pearson Correlation Coefficient

The formula calculates the arithmetic means of both x and y, then calculates how much the set of the points change wrt to the mean point. Then, it sums all contributions to calculate the correlation between x and y. 

## Inductive Bias

Different people (and different AI's) have different experiences, which influences the resulting reasoning.
